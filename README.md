# NRF51_DevelopmentBoard

Inspired & derived from the micro:bit v1, this NRF51822 board is built with loweringthe barrier of entry for STEM education in mind. By reducing onboard sensors and using a cost-optimized BOM, it delivers affordability for classrooms in developing nations. Breadboard-friendly headers encourage hands-on experimentation, while compatibility with MakeCode, Arduino, and partial MicroPython ensures a smooth transition for learners moving from micro:bit to more permanent projects.
